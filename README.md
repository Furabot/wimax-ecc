# Performance Analysis of Error Correction Schemes for WiMAX

- This research intends to simulate some error correction schemes for WiMAX and other low-
latency applications and determine the performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) and
decoding complexity. The simulations have been performed using MATLAB and Simulink. 

- 2 types of encoding schemes have been simulated. It is observed that
concatenated error-correcting schemes are better than non-concatenated schemes,
even though they may induce additional delay, due to their BER performance, linearly
increasing decoder complexity with word-length, parallelizability and improved burst
correction performance.
